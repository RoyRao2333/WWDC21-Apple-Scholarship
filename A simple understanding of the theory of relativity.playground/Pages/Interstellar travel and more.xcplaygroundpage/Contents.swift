This is the _third chapter_ of my Playground. Be sure you've finished the previous two chapters. If so, then please go ahead and enjoy this chapter! :) \
In this chapter, you can learn something interesting about __interstellar travel__ and some thought-provoking experiments, such as the famous __Twin Paradox__. Now go ahead!

### Preface
*/
/*:
Although Einstein's theory of relativity limits the speed of objects within the speed of light, and most places in the universe are light-years away from the earth, this does not limit our interstellar travel. In fact, it is precisely because of the theory of relativity that in the future, human beings can theoretically go to places no matter how far away.
 
The theory of relativity shows that there is no absolute consistency of time and space in the universe. These concepts are relative, and different frames of reference will have their own standards. For humans on Earth, extragalactic galaxies are mostly hundreds of millions of light-years away from the Milky Way, and it takes at least hundreds of millions of years to fly there. But for something approaching the speed of light, extragalactic galaxies are close at hand and can be flown there in a very short period of time, so we might say intergalactic travel can be achieved somewhere in the future of mankind.

### Twin Paradox

![Twin_Paradox](Preface_Assets/Chapter_II/Twin_Paradox.png)
 
- callout(Preposition):
Suppose there are twins on earth of exactly the same age, called Allen and Bob. One day Bob went to another planet, and then came back after some time. After coming back, Bob thinks he is younger than Allen, because Allen was stationary on the earth, while he was moving at a high speed and time slows down.  And Allen, however, thinks he was also moving at a high speed relative to Bob, so his time should be slower. So the contradiction appeared.
 
&nbsp;
 
The key to solving this problem is that the traveler who goes to the space is not gone forever. __The traveler has gone through the process of leaving the earth first and then returning to the earth.__
 
If the traveler keeps flying at a certain speed without turning, since the motion is relative, although both of them insist that the other's clock goes slower, the motion of the two is completely the same. The running time of thier clocks and the age change of the two is also the same.
 
But when the traveler arrives on the planet and turns back, the story is different. From then on, the state of motion of both sides is not the same. Regardless of the acceleration and deceleration time of the traveler at the time of departure and arrival, it is assumed that the traveler moves in a straight direction at a certain speed before and after turning, then the state of motion of both sides is exactly the same in this period of time. \
But when the spacecraft turns around, it first slows down to zero and then accelerates back to Earth. During this period, the spacecraft experienced a state of deceleration, zero speed and acceleration. When its state of motion changes, for the earth in a stationary state, the spaceship is moving. That's why the time of travelers slows down, which is the root cause of the age gap between the two.

### Time Dilation in Passengers (2016 film)
*/
/*:
![Poster](Preface_Assets/Chapter_II/Passengers_poster.png)
_Passengers_ is a 2016 American science-fiction romance film directed by _Morten Tyldum_. The film tells the story of five thousand space passengers taking the Avalon spacecraft to start a new life on another planet.
 
&nbsp;
 
The question I want to ask now is: If the spacecraft takes 120 years to get to another planet at 50% of the speed of light, what is the distance from __the earth__ to another planet __S__?
 
Some people may think: Isn't it easy? 120 years multiplied by 0.5 times the speed of light is 60 light-years. However, this statement is wrong. Because these 120 years are the time viewed on the spacecraft, that is, the proper time. It is not 120 years when you look at it in the Earth's reference system. So we have to study how long it takes based on the Earth's reference system.
