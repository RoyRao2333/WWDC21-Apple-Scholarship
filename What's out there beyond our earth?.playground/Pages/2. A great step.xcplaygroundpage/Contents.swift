 * callout(Mars, who are you?):
 Mars, the fourth closest planet to the sun and the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury, is one of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system. Mars is the god of war in Roman mythology, and in English we often called it _the red planet_. In ancient Chinese, it was called "phosphor" because it was like fire, and its position and brightness often changed so confusingly that people could not predict it. Mars is basically a desert planet, with sand dunes, gravel and no stable liquid water. Like Earth, Mars has a diverse landscape of mountains, plains and canyons. Mars has a relatively thin atmosphere, with an average surface pressure of only 6 hPa. That's about 0.6 percent of Earth's surface pressure, just as 35 kilometers above Earth's surface. The air pressure is so low that sound can travel only about 1.5 percent of the distance compared to Earth.
