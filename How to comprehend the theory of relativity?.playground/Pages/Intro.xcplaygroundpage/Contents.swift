I believe we've all heard of __the theory of relativity__, but what is it anyway? \
Back when I was in high school, my physics teacher was a big fan of _Albert Einstein_ and he would always talk about him whenever he got the chance. So what does __the heory of relativity__ have to do with this great man? Just hear me out!

- callout(Einstein and his Theory of relativity):
Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein was an introverted, bookish child who showed an interest and talent for science at an early age. In 1902, Einstein found a job as a clerk at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, and still, he can do his own theoretical physics research in his spare time. It was there that Einstein laid the cornerstone of his theory of relativity. \
__Theory of relativity__ is a theory of space-time and gravity, mainly proposed by _Albert Einstein_. It can be divided into __special relativity__ and __general relativity__, depending on the subjects studied.  Einstein's theory of relativity greatly changed the law of motion and later replaced __Newton's law of universal gravitation__. It promoted leaps and bounds in physics, and it was also a huge leap for humankind.
 
&nbsp;
 
- Note: __The theory of relativity__ is Einstein's amendment to the __Newtonian mechanics system__, not a substitute. That is to say, Newton’s mechanics is not wrong, but its scope of application is limited. It can only be used under low-speed macroscopic conditions, and Newton’s mechanics is not accurate when the object is moving close to the speed of light. Then we have to use relativistic mechanics to correct it. So we can say that Newtonian mechanics is a special case of relativistic mechanics when the speed is much lower than the speed of light.

- callout(Special relativity?):
__The special theory of relativity__ is a new straight spacetime theory that is different from Newton's view of spacetime and proposed in the article _On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies_ published by Einstein in 1905. __Special__ means that it only applies to inertial reference systems. The starting point of this theory is two basic postulates: __The principle of special relativity__ and __the principle of constant speed of light__. The core equation of the theory is the Lorentz transformation. Special relativity predicts some new effects that Newtonian classical physics does not have, such as __Length Contraction__, __Time Dilation__, and __Relativistic Doppler effect__. Special relativity has become one of the foundations of modern physics theories. All microscopic physical theories (such as elementary particle theory) and macroscopic gravitational theories (such as general relativity) meet the requirements of special relativity. These relativistic dynamics theories have been confirmed by many high-precision experiments.
 
&nbsp;
 
__The special theory of relativity__ is based on the following basic postulates:
- __The principle of special relativity__: All inertial reference systems are equal, that is, the form of physical laws is the same in any inertial reference system. This means that the laws of physics are the same for an observer who is sitting still in the laboratory and an object moving at a constant speed relative to the laboratory.
- __The principle of constant speed of light__: The speed of light in vacuum is constant under any inertial reference frame, and does not change with the relative motion of the light source and the reference frame where the observer is located. The value is __299,792,458 meters per second__.

- callout(General relativity?):
Einstein gave the initial form of __the general theory of relativity__ in a series of papers published around 1915. He first noticed the experimental fact called __the equivalence principle__: the gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass. This fact can also be understood that when there is no force other than gravity, all test objects with sufficiently small mass (that is, the influence of their own mass on the gravitational field can be ignored) move in the same gravitational field in the same way. It was in this way of thinking that Einstein got his general theory of relativity.
 
&nbsp;
 
Systematically, __the general theory of relativity__ includes the following basic postulates:
- __The principle of general relativity__: All coordinate systems (including non-inertial systems) are equal, that is, objective and true physical laws, which should be valid in any coordinate system. For this reason, the laws of physics should be covariant under arbitrary coordinate transformation, so the principle of general relativity is also called the principle of general covariance.
- __Einstein Field Equation__: A set of equations containing 10 equations, proposed by Einstein in 1915 in the theory of general relativity. This set of equations describes that gravity is caused by the bending of space and time produced by matter and energy. As in _Newton's law of universal gravitation_, mass is used as the source of gravity. That is, if there is mass, gravity can be produced. Einstein’s theory of relativity further pointed out that momentum and energy can be used as the source of gravity, and __Gravity field__ is interpreted as __space-time bending__. So when we know how matter and energy are distributed in space-time, we can calculate the curvature of space-time, and the result of space-time curvature is gravity.

/*:
__The theory of relativity__ is mainly useful in two aspects: one is __high-speed motion__ (which is comparable to the speed of light), and the other is __strong gravitational field__. \
For example:
- In the radiotherapy department of hospitals, most of them are equipped with a __particle accelerator__, which produces high-energy particles to produce isotopes for treatment or imaging.
- __The atomic clock__ on the satellite of the Global Positioning system (GPS) is very important for accurate positioning. The algorithm of GPS is based on the principle of constant speed of light. If the principle of constant speed of light does not hold, then the GPS will need to replace a different algorithm to locate accurately.
- __The gravitational lensing effect__ derived from general relativity allows astronomers to observe black holes and dark matter that does not emit electromagnetic waves, and evaluate the mass distribution in space.
